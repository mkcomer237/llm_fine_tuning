      "My entire life has spontaneously combusted over the last couple of months. A 7-year relationship that I moved across the country for four years ago ended suddenly. My ex-partner, my best friend in the world, within a month of our breakup, started dating a mutual friend who has spent the entirety of the pandemic harassing, bullying, manipulating, and gaslighting our friends -- conveniently, everyone but my partner. She has been aware of this, to the extent that I have been comfortable confiding in her, because this friend has been making many of us feel like *garbage*. Meanwhile she is only gotten closer to them as they have driven a wedge between themselves and the rest of us, and the way she describes them is exactly the opposite of how the rest of us experience them; she excuses their behavior easily with things they have told her, but she does not see how a million separate excuses for individual examples of horrible behavior add up to a really ugly picture of a pathological liar and manipulator.And now, suddenly within a month of our breakup, they are fucking. Meanwhile I am trying and failing to find a place to live and a place to work. My best lead on an apartment right now needs me to have a job (I was high risk for covid and went on unemployment and have been struggling to find work), I finally gave up after getting absolutely no responses and applied at a cafe my friend works at, lowering my standards down to the fucking floor. But the commute there is an hour both ways by bus (despite being a 15-minute drive).I am going to end up in an apartment alone (which scares me; I have been depressed my whole life and have a LOT of trouble with it when I am by myself, I cannot do any repetitive tasks without someone to talk to without cycling through suicidal thoughts even at the best of times), without my cat (she is taking the cat because she can afford to, I cannot), losing my insurance (when I left my job due to the pandemic our domestic partnership let me be added to hers) and thus losing my therapist (who was out of network for months, who I would been paying out of pocket for the whole time, $175 per week which I could not afford, who was FINALLY very recently paneled by my insurance and was added to it), just as I am finally coming to terms with a lot of the gender issues and dysphoria I have dealt with my entire life (which my partner helped me through a lot of, and I was just, finally sitting on the precipice of a lot of positive change).Even after we broke up, she wanted to keep living with me. We found a perfect place. We applied, got accepted, they wrote the lease, sent it to us, and *then* she decided she wanted to live alone. She started spending more time with our abusive friend. They started dating, which is an *insane* rebound (less than a month after the end of a 7-year relationship?) and just... extremely insensitive to me (generally I find it shitty to date within a friend group, but to date a friend's recent long-term ex is about a thousand steps too far), and she even realizes this. She told me that, yeah, it was shitty. But she needed to do something for herself, to make herself happy.I am depressed. I have a low opinion of myself. I have a habit of telling myself that I deserve bad things. But I did not deserve *that*. I know I did not. *I am still living with my ex because we are still on this lease; they could not even wait until we lived separately*.I was in a horrible pit of depression during the pandemic. Shit kept going wrong. My mom attempted suicide right beforehand, it started right when I almost landed a new job, then George Floyd and protests and wildfires and a thousand things, and I just sort of shut down due to depression. She felt like she was carrying the weight for both of us. Which is fair. I wish I would been more... conscious, I guess.But to do something so immediate, so callous, so thoughtless, and then to tell me to my face that she recognizes that it is shitty but she does not care, *and* that she wants us to still be best friends despite it.She knows how I feel about them, has for a long time. she is always been my best friend, and I confided in her when I was afraid and confused and did not yet know the rest of our friends were experiencing the same thing. She knows how they have hurt me, hurt our other friends. She just keeps repeating the excuses they have given her.I am going to be stuck in a shitty job with two hours of commuting each day. I am going to be stuck alone in an apartment. I am not going to have the mental energy to do things I want to do: I had just outlined most of a novel series, I was ready to start writing it right before the breakup; I will not have the mental capacity or time to find another fucking job. I had just been grappling with this gender dysphoria and was looking into transitioning. I do not know that I can do that alone. I do not know that I can do *anything* if I am spending 11 hours of my day, 5 days a week traveling and working. My supposed best friend honestly just fucking betrayed me; her leaving suddenly hurt, but jumping in bed with the last fucking person in the world I would ever be comfortable around, someone she knows well has hurt me. I had already been grappling with her dating other people because she said she wanted to start dating casually; I had wrapped my head around it, she said it would be a long time before she could even think about entering another actual relationship... and then, suddenly, she starts fucking an abusive, manipulative, horrible presence in my life, someone our friends have been working up to a confrontation with as they continue to sink their teeth in.I just do not know her anymore. she is a completely different person. I cannot understand what she sees in them, I cannot understand why she is doing any of this, it all came out of nowhere, and I cannot see my life getting any better from here. It feels like my life is over. It feels like I have nothing. Even our friend group is fracturing because of this fucking manipulative bastard sitting in the middle of it, laughing while they tear people down around them. I have no motivation. I am confused. I am lost. I am empty. I feel like I keep falling off of cliffs, one after another.I could move back east, live with my mom again. she is been asking me to do that the whole four years I have lived out west. She cries. She says she is depressed, has nothing without me, that she does not know what to do without me. But living with her was miserable. I could not do anything. I could not flourish. And then after 3 years of long distance I moved out west, giving up everything, and then I *did* flourish. For 4 years I grew and became something. I felt at home, at peace, I had a partner who I loved more than anything. We were a team, we were adventuring companions, we were each other's home.And now that is all gone. I do not know what to do. I do not know where to go from here. I feel empty and lost and shitty and I am stuck with the reality of this person who is been nothing but horrible to my friends and I running off with the woman I love, seemingly developing an entire false personality that is completely the opposite of how they behave whenever she is not around. they are the one fucking person in the world I could not handle her leaving me for. And fucking talking about them makes me feel insane, because \"developing an entire separate personality for the sake of manipulation\" sounds fucking crazy, it is something I would not believe at all if it is not something I was witnessing with my own eyes, and had not already seen my father do for years, and if I was the only one seeing it. But I am not. A number of us do.I just want to wake up. I just want to wake up from this dream. I gave everything for this relationship and now I have nothing. She still wants to be friends, she calls me her best friend, but friends do not act this callous, and I do not know how to be friends with someone who makes me feel this betrayed, this empty, this desperate and lonely and horrible.I do not want to be stuck in an apartment by myself, in a dead-end job that eats up half of every day. I do not want to be stuck with my overbearing mom again. I do not want to be stuck with strangers. Everyone I know is on a lease. None of these situations offer me the time or freedom or energy to be the person I have been fighting to become. I cannot imagine a version of the future that has any kindness, any hope. I have no motivation. I have had a knot in my gut for weeks that will not go away. I want this abuser out of my life. I want my best friend to at least act with some compassion. I want my cat. I want to feel home again, I want to feel family. I want to be able to eat without feeling sick.I want one more night where we sit together in bed reading separate books, and to turn off the lights to hold each other close. I want to go home again. I want to wake up from this fucking nightmare reality that I am stuck in. I want to wake up.<|eot_id|>\n"

My friends had to move somewhere else and then i was all alone for 5 entire years, on high school i made a couple of friends, most of them leaved them because different reasons, money, they died, etc. I got into a fight and i almost lost my eye. I live in a \"box\" since I am never allowed to leave out of house, just to go to the market, or when i go with my grandma, etc, but after that, nothing. On Preparatory (Higher than high school, at least on Mxico) i made a bunch of female friends, just for the 1st semester, and then, all alone, again. My parent's marriage is tearing apart, they shut between themselves a lot lately, like for a month or so they have been so toxic. Tomorrow my grandma is going to have a party and i bet they will get mad at each other. I want to escape, i do not really want to commit suicide, not even if i do not even feel pleasure from jerking off, etc, i do not feel any pleasure from it, i never feel \"happy\" just when i play with some friends online that i constantly get yelled at because i spend a lot more time on the computer lately. I would really love to leave my country so i can start a new life, i have even tried getting a \"sugar mommy\" so i get out of the country, yet it have not happened. But this suicidal thoughts started since i was 11, when my little sister was born, my father loves her a lot, she even gets more attention from my dad, making my mom angry and viceversa. I do not really know what to do, i do not feel pleasure anymore in almost anything, no joy in anything, i just feel sadness, anger, sometimes i feel \"horny\" but that is it, i have dated online a lot of girls, yes, but in the end that maked me feel even worse, i never had a true friend or a real girlfriend, nor anything.

      "My entire life has spontaneously combusted over the last couple of months. A 7-year relationship that I moved across the country for four years ago ended suddenly. My ex-partner, my best friend in the world, within a month of our breakup, started dating a mutual friend who has spent the entirety of the pandemic harassing, bullying, manipulating, and gaslighting our friends -- conveniently, everyone but my partner. She has been aware of this, to the extent that I have been comfortable confiding in her, because this friend has been making many of us feel like *garbage*. Meanwhile she is only gotten closer to them as they have driven a wedge between themselves and the rest of us, and the way she describes them is exactly the opposite of how the rest of us experience them; she excuses their behavior easily with things they have told her, but she does not see how a million separate excuses for individual examples of horrible behavior add up to a really ugly picture of a pathological liar and manipulator.And now, suddenly within a month of our breakup, they are fucking. Meanwhile I am trying and failing to find a place to live and a place to work. My best lead on an apartment right now needs me to have a job (I was high risk for covid and went on unemployment and have been struggling to find work), I finally gave up after getting absolutely no responses and applied at a cafe my friend works at, lowering my standards down to the fucking floor. But the commute there is an hour both ways by bus (despite being a 15-minute drive).I am going to end up in an apartment alone (which scares me; I have been depressed my whole life and have a LOT of trouble with it when I am by myself, I cannot do any repetitive tasks without someone to talk to without cycling through suicidal thoughts even at the best of times), without my cat (she is taking the cat because she can afford to, I cannot), losing my insurance (when I left my job due to the pandemic our domestic partnership let me be added to hers) and thus losing my therapist (who was out of network for months, who I would been paying out of pocket for the whole time, $175 per week which I could not afford, who was FINALLY very recently paneled by my insurance and was added to it), just as I am finally coming to terms with a lot of the gender issues and dysphoria I have dealt with my entire life (which my partner helped me through a lot of, and I was just, finally sitting on the precipice of a lot of positive change).Even after we broke up, she wanted to keep living with me. We found a perfect place. We applied, got accepted, they wrote the lease, sent it to us, and *then* she decided she wanted to live alone. She started spending more time with our abusive friend. They started dating, which is an *insane* rebound (less than a month after the end of a 7-year relationship?) and just... extremely insensitive to me (generally I find it shitty to date within a friend group, but to date a friend's recent long-term ex is about a thousand steps too far), and she even realizes this. She told me that, yeah, it was shitty. But she needed to do something for herself, to make herself happy.I am depressed. I have a low opinion of myself. I have a habit of telling myself that I deserve bad things. But I did not deserve *that*. I know I did not. *I am still living with my ex because we are still on this lease; they could not even wait until we lived separately*.I was in a horrible pit of depression during the pandemic. Shit kept going wrong. My mom attempted suicide right beforehand, it started right when I almost landed a new job, then George Floyd and protests and wildfires and a thousand things, and I just sort of shut down due to depression. She felt like she was carrying the weight for both of us. Which is fair. I wish I would been more... conscious, I guess.But to do something so immediate, so callous, so thoughtless, and then to tell me to my face that she recognizes that it is shitty but she does not care, *and* that she wants us to still be best friends despite it.She knows how I feel about them, has for a long time. she is always been my best friend, and I confided in her when I was afraid and confused and did not yet know the rest of our friends were experiencing the same thing. She knows how they have hurt me, hurt our other friends. She just keeps repeating the excuses they have given her.I am going to be stuck in a shitty job with two hours of commuting each day. I am going to be stuck alone in an apartment. I am not going to have the mental energy to do things I want to do: I had just outlined most of a novel series, I was ready to start writing it right before the breakup; I will not have the mental capacity or time to find another fucking job. I had just been grappling with this gender dysphoria and was looking into transitioning. I do not know that I can do that alone. I do not know that I can do *anything* if I am spending 11 hours of my day, 5 days a week traveling and working. My supposed best friend honestly just fucking betrayed me; her leaving suddenly hurt, but jumping in bed with the last fucking person in the world I would ever be comfortable around, someone she knows well has hurt me. I had already been grappling with her dating other people because she said she wanted to start dating casually; I had wrapped my head around it, she said it would be a long time before she could even think about entering another actual relationship... and then, suddenly, she starts fucking an abusive, manipulative, horrible presence in my life, someone our friends have been working up to a confrontation with as they continue to sink their teeth in.I just do not know her anymore. she is a completely different person. I cannot understand what she sees in them, I cannot understand why she is doing any of this, it all came out of nowhere, and I cannot see my life getting any better from here. It feels like my life is over. It feels like I have nothing. Even our friend group is fracturing because of this fucking manipulative bastard sitting in the middle of it, laughing while they tear people down around them. I have no motivation. I am confused. I am lost. I am empty. I feel like I keep falling off of cliffs, one after another.I could move back east, live with my mom again. she is been asking me to do that the whole four years I have lived out west. She cries. She says she is depressed, has nothing without me, that she does not know what to do without me. But living with her was miserable. I could not do anything. I could not flourish. And then after 3 years of long distance I moved out west, giving up everything, and then I *did* flourish. For 4 years I grew and became something. I felt at home, at peace, I had a partner who I loved more than anything. We were a team, we were adventuring companions, we were each other's home.And now that is all gone. I do not know what to do. I do not know where to go from here. I feel empty and lost and shitty and I am stuck with the reality of this person who is been nothing but horrible to my friends and I running off with the woman I love, seemingly developing an entire false personality that is completely the opposite of how they behave whenever she is not around. they are the one fucking person in the world I could not handle her leaving me for. And fucking talking about them makes me feel insane, because \"developing an entire separate personality for the sake of manipulation\" sounds fucking crazy, it is something I would not believe at all if it is not something I was witnessing with my own eyes, and had not already seen my father do for years, and if I was the only one seeing it. But I am not. A number of us do.I just want to wake up. I just want to wake up from this dream. I gave everything for this relationship and now I have nothing. She still wants to be friends, she calls me her best friend, but friends do not act this callous, and I do not know how to be friends with someone who makes me feel this betrayed, this empty, this desperate and lonely and horrible.I do not want to be stuck in an apartment by myself, in a dead-end job that eats up half of every day. I do not want to be stuck with my overbearing mom again. I do not want to be stuck with strangers. Everyone I know is on a lease. None of these situations offer me the time or freedom or energy to be the person I have been fighting to become. I cannot imagine a version of the future that has any kindness, any hope. I have no motivation. I have had a knot in my gut for weeks that will not go away. I want this abuser out of my life. I want my best friend to at least act with some compassion. I want my cat. I want to feel home again, I want to feel family. I want to be able to eat without feeling sick.I want one more night where we sit together in bed reading separate books, and to turn off the lights to hold each other close. I want to go home again. I want to wake up from this fucking nightmare reality that I have been living in for months, that I thought I was living in love, that I thought was my life.<|eot_id|>\n"

      "I'm relapsing on my past HA, at least right now. [Long post] In October of 2017, I had my first actual panic attack and it was massive. I never figured out where it came from, but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 2-3 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then, I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 24/7, so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgs/EKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times, with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100% healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years, which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke, drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through, but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears (biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches) and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely, but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondria/health illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason, it was like a complete 180, from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.\n",

      "Lately, I've just been more down than usual and I plan on seeing another therapist to try and tackle that, but I think it's partially making the hypochondriac I am come back out. Example: about two nights ago, I was getting ready to take a nap, but I was on my phone for a few, getting settled, propping myself with my right hand/arm on my side. Later, I would wake up and I started gaming a bit after, but I noticed my upper right arm and lower shoulder have sharp pains after moving it a few certain ways. I brushed it off because I figured, \"I probably put too much strain on it when I was on my side before my nap\". Well it's been a few nights now or so and while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten better, I think. Fine, whatever. But then I noticed pains in my forearm, closer to my wrist that would come and go slightly. Then I started feeling that later in my right forearm. Today I was pulling weeds and when I got back up, my shins had sharp pains for a few minutes. I was feeling off and light-headed and thought I may be dehydrated because I drank last night and didn't really do a good job keeping myself hydrated then. So I did the worst thing possible - I googled dehydration symptoms. When it becomes \"severe\" and should seek help, etc. Granted this was just all on the same page, but I didn't have to read it. I legit just wasn't sure if it was dehydration and it did more hurt than it helped. I'm feeling better after some water, but now while I'm not constantly Googling anything on the exception to see what the symptoms of dehydration were and effects it could have on the body, I'm fighting that feeling of being worried about the pains I mentioned above. If it was just the shoulder pain, or just the here and there forearm pain or the mild discomfort I feel in my fingers... basically if I just wasn't feeling pain in varying intensities and one or two areas, I could easily reason with myself.\n",

      "I am not quite suicidal, but I am not quite okay. I am I am limbo. I lay in bed, trying to sleep and I have so much anxiety about going to work. Numb from depression. My family wants to celebrate Christmas in July, and usually Christmas songs and movies give me that warm fuzzy childhood feeling. I feel void. I lay in bed, I do not want to face the day. I want to sleep. Stay in bed. I think if I die, my problems would go away. But at the same time, I do not want to die. I want to enjoy life. I sink to that level of borderline SI, but then I go back to thinking how I could improve my life.Today, I got a friend request from my cousin. you would think that would cheer me up. No. It made me more depressed and feeling useless. The reason? Three week ago, I sent her a friend request. No reply. No response. I assumed she just does not check her social media often. However, it occurred to me today. If she sent me a friend request, that means she declined my friend request 3 weeks ago. Otherwise, it would have said she accepted my friend request. That means, she must have felt guilty and friended me out of obligation. My own family does not care about me or my life. Her first instinct was to not friend me. I am lost. Any advice?
